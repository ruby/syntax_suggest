## 1.0.1

## 1.0.0 (Library renamed to syntax_suggest )

- [Breaking] Output "Syntax OK" will no longer be output when `syntax_suggest` is fired due to a syntax error. (https://github.com/ruby/syntax_suggest/pull/158)
- [Breaking] Rename `dead_end` to `syntax_suggest` (https://github.com/zombocom/dead_end/pull/154)
- [Breaking] Lazy loading moved from `autoload` to manually checking for constants and requiring `dead_end/api`. To manually use any SyntaxSuggest internals you MUST require `dead_end/api`, otherwise it will be lazy loaded on syntax error (https://github.com/zombocom/dead_end/pull/148)
- Default to highlighted output on Ruby 3.2 (https://github.com/zombocom/dead_end/pull/150)
- Debug functionality enabled by `DEBUG=1` env var is now under `SYNTAX_SUGGEST_DEBUG=1`. Note this is not a stable interface or feature. Output content is subject to change without major version change (https://github.com/zombocom/dead_end/pull/149)
- Enable/Disable dead_end by using the `dead_end` kwarg in `detailed_message` (https://github.com/zombocom/dead_end/pull/147)
- Respect `highlight` kwarg in Ruby 3.2's `detailed_message` to enable/disable control characters (https://github.com/zombocom/dead_end/pull/147)
- Added workarounds for running on ruby/ruby repo (https://github.com/ruby/syntax_suggest/pull/156)

## dead_end 4.0.0

- Code that does not have an associated file (eval and streamed) no longer produce a warning saying that the file could not be found. To produce a warning with these code types run with DEBUG=1 environment variable. (https://github.com/zombocom/dead_end/pull/143)
- [Breaking] Lazy load SyntaxSuggest internals only if there is a Syntax error. Use `require "dead_end"; require "dead_end/api"` to load eagerly all internals. Otherwise `require "dead_end"` will set up an autoload for the first time the SyntaxSuggest module is used in code. This should only happen on a syntax error. (https://github.com/zombocom/dead_end/pull/142)
- Monkeypatch `SyntaxError#detailed_message` in Ruby 3.2+ instead of `require`, `load`, and `require_relative` (https://github.com/zombocom/dead_end/pull/139)
